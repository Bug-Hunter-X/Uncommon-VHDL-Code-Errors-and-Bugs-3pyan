In VHDL, a common error is the incorrect use of signal assignments within processes.  For example, assigning a value to a signal inside a process without using a wait statement can lead to unexpected behavior. The signal might not update at the correct time, or the simulation might deadlock.

```vhdl
process (clk)
begin
  if rising_edge(clk) then
    count <= count + 1; -- Incorrect assignment, needs wait statement
  end if;
end process;
```

Another error is incorrect handling of signal types. Mismatching types between signals and their drivers can cause compilation errors or simulation failures.  Also, forgetting to declare signals can lead to a compiler error.  And in concurrent statements, make sure to handle signal updates properly.
