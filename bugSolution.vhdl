The solution involves using a `wait` statement within the process to ensure proper signal updates at the correct time. The `wait` statement will suspend process execution until a specified condition is met. In this case, it's important to wait for a clock edge so that the counter updates only at the correct clock cycle.

```vhdl
process (clk)
begin
  if rising_edge(clk) then
    count <= count + 1;  -- Correct assignment with wait statement
    wait until falling_edge(clk); --Add wait for proper execution 
  end if;
end process;
```

To handle type mismatches, always verify that the data types of signals and their drivers are compatible. Explicit type conversions might be needed in some cases.  Make sure to declare all signals before using them in the code. For concurrent signal updates, consider using appropriate techniques like `if`, `case` and `when` statements to manage signal updates correctly. Always check for race conditions and unintended signal conflicts.
